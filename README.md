# VGS IOT sensor network demo

- Coming soon! Protect and operate on IOT/sensor network data.   
- This demo will use an ESP32 format device with Arduino bootloader.   
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32   
- The demo shows how easy it is to safely, securely operate on sensor network data within the constraints of a low power - limited compute device which may need near wire speed processing at the backend
