# VGS IOT sensor network demo

- Coming soon! Protect and operate on IOT/sensor network data.   
- This demo will use an ESP8266 format device with Arduino bootloader.   

- The demo shows how easy it is to safely, securely operate on sensor network data within the constraints of a low power - limited compute device which may need near wire speed processing at the backend
